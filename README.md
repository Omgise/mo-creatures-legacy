# Mo Creatures Legacy
<strong> Development for this project has finished. This project will not be receiving any further updates. </strong>
The final version of Mo' Creatures for 1.7.10 was unfinished and was riddled with bugs. This project fixes that.

The main aim of Mo' Creatures Legacy is to provide a fully working legacy version of Mo' Creatures for 1.7.10.



<strong> DISCLAIMER: </strong>
* This project is not endorsed by Dr Zhark or anyone from the original Mo' Creatures team.
* This project does not backport features from newer versions of Mo' Creatures.
 

 
## How to Install:
Mo' Creatures Legacy is a stand-alone mod and does NOT require any other mods as dependencies.
Assuming you have Java 8 installed on your computer and Forge installed for 1.7.10, just download the mod and put it into the mods folder. 

Do NOT try to use this mod with the Custom Mob Spawner mod, if you need to adjust entity spawns use the Just Another Mob Spawner instead.

Do NOT try to load this mod into a world that previously had the original Mo' Creatures mod.
