Special Thanks:
	The Camping Rusher - If I hadn't watched his Mo' Creatures let's play as a kid, I never would have gotten into the Mo' Creatures mod, and I never would have known all the problems with the original Mo' Creatures mod for 1.7.10. Link to the playlist of his let's play: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzzbNR8UfN0cWzzCLucxJSII_86G9BuE .
