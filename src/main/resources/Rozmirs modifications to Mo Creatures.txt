Fixed Witchery integration werewolves not taking damage in human form when hit by Witchery witch hunters.


NOTE: Witchery witch hunters can tell the difference between normal villagers, Minecraft Comes Alive villagers, and Witchery integration werewolves. Witchery witch hunters will find and kill Witchery integration werewolves even if they are in their human form. 


Added config option to control whether the human form for Mo' Creatures werewolves use realistic human sounds. This is set to false by default.


Fixed Mo' Creatures werewolf not taking proper damage in human form.


Fixed crash when the player tries to hook a Werewolf using a fishing rod.


Fixed wolfsbane interaction with Witchery werewolf integration villagers and Witchery werewolf integration Minecraft Comes Alive villagers.


Simplified the code for the ostrich interact function.


Fixed elephant chest achievement description for all lang files.


Simplified the code for wyverns dropping armour.


Fixed white werewolf lips. Also removed unused texture.


The following creatures now have attack damages that scale with the difficulty:
	Scorpion
	Wraith
	Flame Wraith
	Golem Block
	Silver Skeleton <- also increased base attack damage


Tweaked Thaumcraft aspects for:
	Wyvern
	Silver Skeleton


The Songhua River mammoth can now carry 4 elephant chests just like the regular mammoth.


All mammoths can now carry a mammoth platform.


Improved meaningfulness of identifiers in the code for elephant.


Fixed elephants always destroying blocks without being whipped.


Fixed elephant tusks not taking damage when breaking blocks.


Fixed creature duplication glitch with mob confinement items from the Mob Confinement mod.


Fixed creeper extension not having a chance to mutate into a mutant creeper if the Mutant Creatures mod is installed and has been affected with chemical X.


Added a helper mod "Wolf Altar Replacement" to change the model and texture of the wolf altar from the Witchery mod.


Improved efficiency of empty string detection.


Max-level Witchery werewolf players can now recruit werewolves that are in their werewolf form by right-clicking them with an empty hand. Recruited werewolves will follow the player that recruited them, and will not attack the player even if the player that recruited them is in human form. Recruited werewolves can be told to stay put by being shift right-clicked by the player that recruited them. However, the recruitment will reset when the werewolf entity returns to its human form. Recruited werewolves will despawn unless they have a name tag.


Added water plants from the Plant Mega Pack mod as food items for small fish and fishy. Small fish can only eat freshwater plants, and Fishy can only eat saltwater plants, this reflects the places they live in.


Fixed crash when trying to put a mammoth platform to a brown mammoth. This was fixed by removing the ability to put mammoth platforms on brown mammoths, this also returns the mammoth platform to its original state (only being able to be equipped on Songhua river mammoths).


Fixed pet amulets, horse amulets, and fish nets making the max health of any stored creature to 20HP.


Fixed aquatic creatures always trying to swim up to the surface of water.


Fixed the second player not being able to mount a mammoth platform. Also now for a player to mount a mammoth platform while another player is riding the Songhua River mammoth, they first must make the mammoth sit by sneaking near it, and after the mammoth sits they will need to jump while close to the mammoth to get onto the mammoth platform.


Final corrections for the en_US.lang file.


Fixed turtles not recognizing that they are a teenage mutant ninja turtle if they are given a TMNT name in one of the supported languages. Also removed forgiveness of spelling mistakes for English TMNT names, this is because players now have the achievements page where they can find the proper spelling of that TMNT name. 


Aquatic creatures can now swim both up and down by themselves.


Rays no longer move their tail sideways when swimming.


Rays can now be healed using raw fish and any other item in the "listAllfishraw" ore dictionary.


Medium fish can now be healed using raw fish and any other item in the "listAllfishraw" ore dictionary. This is because in real life, cod, bass, and salmon are predatory fish, some of which are cannibals.


Fixed ray health.


Fixed the texture for the back of the hell rat tail. Also improved hell rat body texture. 


Moved the "Wolf Altar Replacement" mod to its own repository and webpage. The "Wolf Altar Replacement" mod will be completed at a later date.

Fixed Mo' Creatures werewolves not fighting back if they are in their werewolf form and are attacked by a witch hunter.
